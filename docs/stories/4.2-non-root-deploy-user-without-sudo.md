# Story 4.2: Non-Root Deploy User Without Sudo

**Epic:** Epic 4 - Error Handling and Edge Cases
**Priority:** Should-have

## Description

Verify behavior when deploy user lacks sudo privileges.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Deploy user exists but not in sudo group
- [x] Script attempts sudo command (e.g., Caddy install)
- [x] sudo fails with permission error
- [x] Script catches error and logs: "User does not have sudo privileges"
- [x] Suggests adding user to sudo group: `sudo usermod -aG sudo deploy`
- [x] Exit code 1

## Dependencies

Actual execution on VPS with misconfigured user

## Testing Notes

```bash
# On VPS, ensure deploy user is NOT in sudo group
# Then run setup-vps.sh
./setup-vps.sh --dry-run --verbose

# Should fail when attempting sudo command
# Error should mention sudo privileges
```
