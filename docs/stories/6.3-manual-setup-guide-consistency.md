# Story 6.3: Manual Setup Guide Consistency

**Epic:** Epic 6 - Documentation and Configuration Validation
**Priority:** Must-have

## Description

Verify `docs/manual-setup-guide.md` matches script automation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Each section corresponds to a phase in `setup-vps.sh`
- [ ] Manual commands match what script executes
- [ ] Directory paths, file locations, and commands are identical
- [ ] Guide includes all steps: user setup, Caddy install, Node.js/PM2, jq, UFW, directories, registry, Caddyfile, verification
- [ ] Documented as reference for understanding automation
- [ ] Cross-referenced in README

## Dependencies

Story 1.1-1.39 (script implementation)

## Testing Notes

```bash
# Compare manual guide steps with script phases
# For each phase in setup-vps.sh, verify manual guide has equivalent commands

# Example:
# - Script: installs Caddy via apt repository
# - Manual: same commands
# - Script: creates /var/www, /home/deploy/apps
# - Manual: same mkdir commands
# etc.
```
