# Story 1.33: Software Installation - Caddy

**Epic:** Epic 1 - setup-vps.sh Core Functionality Testing
**Priority:** Must-have

## Description

Verify Caddy installation from official repository on fresh VPS.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] On fresh VPS with no Caddy: script installs via official apt repository
- [x] Commands executed:
  - Add Cloudflare GPG key
  - Add Caddy apt repository
  - `apt update`
  - `apt install caddy -y`
- [x] After install, `caddy version` succeeds
- [x] Caddy service is enabled and running
- [x] On subsequent runs, installation is skipped and version is logged

## Dependencies

Story 1.10 (actual execution on fresh VPS)

## Testing Notes

```bash
# On fresh VPS (no Caddy installed)
./setup-vps.sh --dry-run --verbose

# Should show commands to add key, add repo, apt update, apt install caddy

# Actual execution
./setup-vps.sh

# Verify
ssh deploy@vps "caddy version"
ssh deploy@vps "systemctl is-active caddy"
# Should show: active

# Second run
./setup-vps.sh
# Should log Caddy version and skip installation
```
