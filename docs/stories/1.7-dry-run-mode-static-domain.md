# Story 1.7: Dry-Run Mode - Static Domain

**Epic:** Epic 1 - setup-vps.sh Core Functionality Testing
**Priority:** Must-have

## Description

Verify dry-run mode shows all intended actions without making changes for static domains.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `./setup-vps.sh --dry-run --verbose` outputs all commands that would be executed
- [x] No actual changes are made to VPS (no SSH commands executed)
- [x] Output includes: validation, software installation checks, registry update preview, directory creation, Caddyfile generation preview
- [x] Exit code is 0 if validation passes

## Dependencies

Stories 1.3-1.6

## Testing Notes

```bash
cat > .env.deploy << 'EOF'
VPS_USER=deploy
VPS_IP=your.vps.ip
DOMAIN=test-static.com
DOMAIN_TYPE=static
EOF

./setup-vps.sh --dry-run --verbose > output.txt
echo $?  # Should be 0

# Verify output contains expected phases
grep -E "Phase 1|Phase 2|Phase 3|Phase 4|Phase 5|Phase 6|Phase 7|Phase 8" output.txt

# Verify no actual SSH commands were run (dry-run should show them but not execute)
# In dry-run, SSH commands should be echoed but not executed
```
