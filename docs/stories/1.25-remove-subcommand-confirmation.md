# Story 1.25: Remove Subcommand - Confirmation

**Epic:** Epic 1 - setup-vps.sh Core Functionality Testing
**Priority:** Must-have

## Description

Verify `setup-vps.sh remove` prompts for confirmation before making changes.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `./setup-vps.sh remove` reads `.env.deploy` to get `DOMAIN`
- [x] If domain not in registry, logs "Domain 'X' not found in registry" and exits with code 0
- [x] If domain exists, prints what will be removed:
  - Domain entry from registry
  - PM2 process stop/delete (if dynamic)
  - Caddyfile regeneration
- [x] Prompts: "Are you sure? (y/N)"
- [x] Any input other than 'y' or 'Y' aborts operation
- [x] Confirmed ('y') proceeds with removal

## Dependencies

Stories 1.10-1.12

## Testing Notes

```bash
# Domain not in registry
./setup-vps.sh remove --dry-run
# Should show "Domain 'X' not found" and exit 0

# Domain exists
./setup-vps.sh remove --dry-run
# Should show what would be removed and prompt
# Answer 'n' → aborts
# Answer 'y' → proceeds (with --dry-run, shows commands only)
```
