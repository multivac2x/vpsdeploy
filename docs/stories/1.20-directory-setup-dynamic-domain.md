# Story 1.20: Directory Setup - Dynamic Domain

**Epic:** Epic 1 - setup-vps.sh Core Functionality Testing
**Priority:** Must-have

## Description

Verify correct directory structure is created for dynamic domains.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Directory `${VPS_APPS_PATH}/${DOMAIN}` is created (default: `/home/deploy/apps/example.com`)
- [x] Directory is owned by `VPS_USER`
- [x] Caddy log directory `/var/log/caddy/` exists
- [x] Caddy user (`www-data`) can write to log directory

## Dependencies

Story 1.10 (actual execution)

## Testing Notes

```bash
# After setup-vps.sh with dynamic domain
ssh deploy@vps "ls -ld /home/deploy/apps/example.com"
# Should show: drwxr-xr-x 2 deploy deploy

ssh deploy@vps "ls -ld /var/log/caddy"
# Should exist and be writable by www-data
# Typically: drwxr-xr-x 2 www-data www-data
```
