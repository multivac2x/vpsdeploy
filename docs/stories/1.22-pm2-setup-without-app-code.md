# Story 1.22: PM2 Setup - Dynamic Domain without App Code

**Epic:** Epic 1 - setup-vps.sh Core Functionality Testing
**Priority:** Should-have

## Description

Verify behavior when app code has not been deployed yet.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] If `${VPS_APPS_PATH}/${DOMAIN}/package.json` does NOT exist
- [x] PM2 start is skipped
- [x] Reminder message is printed: "Deploy your app code to ${VPS_APPS_PATH}/${DOMAIN} then run: pm2 start npm --name '${DOMAIN}' -- start"
- [x] `pm2 save` still executed
- [x] `pm2 startup` configured if needed

## Dependencies

Story 1.20 (directory created, but no code)

## Testing Notes

```bash
# Run setup-vps.sh for dynamic domain BEFORE running deploy.sh
# (i.e., app directory exists but empty or without package.json)
./setup-vps.sh

# Should see reminder message in output
# PM2 process should NOT be started
ssh deploy@vps "pm2 list | grep example.com"
# Should show: no process
```
