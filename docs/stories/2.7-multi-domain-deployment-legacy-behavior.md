# Story 2.7: Multi-Domain Deployment (Legacy Behavior)

**Epic:** Epic 2 - deploy.sh Core Functionality Testing
**Priority:** Must-have

## Description

Verify that the refactored script still supports single-domain mode as per PRD.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Script reads single `DOMAIN` from `.env.deploy`
- [ ] No interactive domain selection (that was legacy multi-domain behavior)
- [ ] Deploys only to the configured domain
- [ ] If user tries to pass domain as argument, script ignores it or shows error (PRD says single-domain pattern)

## Dependencies

Story 2.2

## Testing Notes

```bash
cat > .env.deploy << 'EOF'
VPS_USER=deploy
VPS_IP=your.vps.ip
DOMAIN=my-repo-domain.com
DOMAIN_TYPE=static
EOF

./deploy.sh --dry-run
# Should deploy only to my-repo-domain.com

# Try passing domain argument
./deploy.sh other-domain --dry-run
# Should either ignore argument or show error (not show interactive menu)
```
