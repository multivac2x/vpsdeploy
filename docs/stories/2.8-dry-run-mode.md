# Story 2.8: Dry-Run Mode

**Epic:** Epic 2 - deploy.sh Core Functionality Testing
**Priority:** Must-have

## Description

Verify `--dry-run` shows what would be transferred without making changes.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] With `--dry-run`, build still runs (unless `--skip-build`)
- [x] Rsync uses `--dry-run` flag
- [x] Post-deploy SSH commands are NOT executed
- [x] No files transferred to VPS
- [x] Summary shows "Dry run complete" instead of "All done!"

## Dependencies

Stories 2.3-2.6

## Testing Notes

```bash
./deploy.sh --dry-run --verbose 2>&1 | grep -E "dry-run|Would"
# Should indicate dry-run mode

# Check that post-deploy commands are not shown as executed
./deploy.sh --dry-run --verbose 2>&1 | grep -E "npm install|pm2 restart"
# Should show these commands in the "would execute" list but not actually run
```
