# Story 1.37: Verbose Mode

**Epic:** Epic 1 - setup-vps.sh Core Functionality Testing
**Priority:** Should-have

## Description

Verify `--verbose` flag shows detailed SSH command output.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] With `--verbose`, script shows stdout/stderr from remote commands
- [x] Without `--verbose`, remote command output is suppressed (only local logs)
- [x] Verbose mode works with all subcommands (setup, status, remove)
- [x] Can be combined with `--dry-run`

## Dependencies

Story 1.10 (actual execution)

## Testing Notes

```bash
# Without verbose
./setup-vps.sh 2>&1 | grep -E "caddy version|jq --version"
# Should show minimal output

# With verbose
./setup-vps.sh --verbose 2>&1 | grep -E "caddy version|jq --version"
# Should show full command output from remote

# With dry-run + verbose
./setup-vps.sh --dry-run --verbose
# Shows what commands would be executed with full detail
```
