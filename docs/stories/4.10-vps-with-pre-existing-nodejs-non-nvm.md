# Story 4.10: VPS with Pre-Existing Node.js (Non-nvm)

**Epic:** Epic 4 - Error Handling and Edge Cases
**Priority:** Should-have

## Description

Verify behavior when Node.js is already installed system-wide (not via nvm).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] VPS has Node.js from nodesource or other method
- [ ] `node --version` succeeds
- [ ] Script detects Node.js is installed and skips nvm installation
- [ ] PM2 check/install proceeds normally
- [ ] No conflicts, script works correctly

## Dependencies

Story 1.35

## Testing Notes

```bash
# On VPS, install Node.js via nodesource or other method (not nvm)
# Then run setup-vps.sh with dynamic domain

./setup-vps.sh --dry-run --verbose

# Should detect Node.js is installed and skip nvm installation
# PM2 install should still proceed if not present
```
