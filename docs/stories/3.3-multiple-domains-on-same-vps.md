# Story 3.3: Multiple Domains on Same VPS

**Epic:** Epic 3 - Integration and End-to-End Testing
**Priority:** Must-have

## Description

Verify adding multiple domains from different repos works correctly.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Repo A (static domain A): run `setup-vps.sh` → domain A configured
- [x] Repo B (static domain B): run `setup-vps.sh` → both domains A and B in registry
- [x] Repo C (dynamic domain C): run `setup-vps.sh` → all three domains in registry
- [x] Caddyfile contains all three domains in alphabetical order
- [x] Caddy reloaded successfully
- [x] All three domains accessible via HTTPS with valid SSL
- [x] Each domain serves correct content (static A, static B, dynamic C)
- [x] `setup-vps.sh status` shows all three with correct status

## Dependencies

Stories 3.1, 3.2

## Testing Notes

```bash
# From repo A (static-a.com)
./setup-vps.sh
# Verify domain A in registry

# From repo B (static-b.com)
./setup-vps.sh
# Verify both A and B in registry

# From repo C (dynamic-c.com)
./setup-vps.sh
# Verify all three in registry

# Check Caddyfile order
ssh deploy@vps "sudo cat /etc/caddy/Caddyfile" | grep -E "^[a-z]+\.com \{" | sed 's/ .*//'
# Should be alphabetical

# Test each domain via HTTPS
curl -I https://static-a.com
curl -I https://static-b.com
curl -I https://dynamic-c.com
# All should return 200

# Run status
./setup-vps.sh status
# Should show all three with correct types and status
```
