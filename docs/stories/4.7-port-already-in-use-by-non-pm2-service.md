# Story 4.7: Port Already in Use by Non-PM2 Service

**Epic:** Epic 4 - Error Handling and Edge Cases
**Priority:** Could-have

## Description

Verify detection when a port is occupied by a non-PM2 process.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Some other service (e.g., another web server) listening on port 3000
- [ ] Dynamic domain configured with `DOMAIN_PORT=3000`
- [ ] `setup-vps.sh` checks port conflict ONLY against other domains in registry
- [ ] Does NOT check against system-wide port usage (by design)
- [ ] PM2 start may fail if port is taken, but that's separate
- [ ] Document this limitation: port conflict check is only within registry

## Dependencies

Story 1.13

## Testing Notes

```bash
# On VPS, start a service on port 3000 (e.g., another Node.js app not managed by PM2)
# Then run setup-vps.sh for a domain with DOMAIN_PORT=3000

# Should succeed (no registry conflict)
# But PM2 start may fail if port is actually in use

# Document that port conflict detection is registry-only, not system-wide
```
