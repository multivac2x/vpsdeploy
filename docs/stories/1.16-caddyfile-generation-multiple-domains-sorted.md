# Story 1.16: Caddyfile Generation - Multiple Domains Sorted

**Epic:** Epic 1 - setup-vps.sh Core Functionality Testing
**Priority:** Should-have

## Description

Verify domains appear in alphabetical order in generated Caddyfile.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Registry contains domains: "zebra.com", "alpha.com", "beta.com"
- [x] Generated Caddyfile lists them in order: alpha.com, beta.com, zebra.com
- [x] Order is deterministic (same on repeated runs)

## Dependencies

Story 1.11

## Testing Notes

```bash
# Ensure registry has these three domains (order doesn't matter in registry)
# Then check Caddyfile order
ssh deploy@vps "sudo cat /etc/caddy/Caddyfile" | grep -E "^[a-z0-9]+\.com \{" | sed 's/ .*//'

# Should output in alphabetical order:
# alpha.com
# beta.com
# zebra.com
```
