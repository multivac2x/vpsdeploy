# Story 6.6: Deploy.sh Test Plan Creation and Execution

**Epic:** Epic 6 - Documentation and Configuration Validation
**Priority:** Must-have

## Description

Create comprehensive test plan for deploy.sh and execute all tests.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create `plans/test-deploy.sh.md` with test structure similar to `test-setup-vps.sh.md`
- [ ] Include tests for all Stories 2.1-2.14
- [ ] Execute all tests against implementation
- [ ] Document any failures and fix implementation
- [ ] All tests pass

## Dependencies

Complete implementation of deploy.sh

## Testing Notes

This story creates the test plan file (which we already created earlier) and executes it.

```bash
# Ensure plans/test-deploy.sh.md exists (we created it)
# Execute all tests in that plan
# Document results
# Fix any failures
# Re-run until all pass
```
