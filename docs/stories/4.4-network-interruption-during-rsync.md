# Story 4.4: Network Interruption During Rsync

**Epic:** Epic 4 - Error Handling and Edge Cases
**Priority:** Could-have

## Description

Verify rsync handles network drop gracefully.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Simulate network interruption during large file transfer
- [ ] Rsync exits with non-zero status
- [ ] Script catches error and exits
- [ ] Partial files on VPS are in consistent state (rsync atomicity)
- [ ] User can retry deploy (rsync will resume/skip as appropriate)

## Dependencies

Actual execution with network control

## Testing Notes

```bash
# Use tc or firewall to drop connection during large rsync
# ./deploy.sh

# Should fail with network error
# Retry should work: ./deploy.sh (rsync will transfer remaining files)
```
