# Story 1.24: Status Subcommand

**Epic:** Epic 1 - setup-vps.sh Core Functionality Testing
**Priority:** Must-have

## Description

Verify `setup-vps.sh status` displays registry information without making changes.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `./setup-vps.sh status` connects to VPS and reads `/etc/caddy/domains.json`
- [x] Displays status table (same format as summary)
- [x] Checks Caddy: domain present in active Caddyfile
- [x] Checks Static: web root contains files
- [x] Checks Dynamic: PM2 process running
- [x] Checks SSL: `curl -sI https://${domain}` returns 200
- [x] Displays Caddy service status (`systemctl is-active caddy`)
- [x] Displays disk usage and memory summary
- [x] No changes are made to VPS (read-only operation)
- [x] Exit code 0

## Dependencies

Stories 1.10-1.12 (registry must exist)

## Testing Notes

```bash
./setup-vps.sh status

# Should show:
# - Status table with all domains
# - Caddy service status line
# - Disk usage: df -h
# - Memory: free -h
```
