# Story 5.6: SSL Certificate Renewal

**Epic:** Epic 5 - VPS Deployment Scenarios and Operations
**Priority:** Must-have

## Description

Verify Let's Encrypt certificates auto-renew via Caddy.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Domain configured and accessible via HTTPS
- [ ] Check certificate: `sudo caddy list-certificates`
- [ ] Certificate expiry is ~90 days
- [ ] Caddy auto-renews before expiry (document typical renewal window)
- [ ] Renewal is seamless (no downtime)
- [ ] Test renewal: manually trigger with `sudo caddy reload` (Caddy will renew if needed)

## Dependencies

Story 3.1 or 3.2 (working HTTPS)

## Testing Notes

```bash
# 1. Verify domain has SSL
ssh deploy@vps "sudo caddy list-certificates"
# Should show certificate with expiry date ~90 days from now

# 2. Check Caddy logs for renewal attempts
ssh deploy@vps "sudo journalctl -u caddy -f | grep -i renew"
# Caddy automatically attempts renewal when cert is ~24h from expiry

# 3. Manual renewal test (if cert is already valid, reload won't renew)
ssh deploy@vps "sudo caddy reload"
# Should reload without errors

# Document that Caddy handles renewal automatically, no cron needed
```
