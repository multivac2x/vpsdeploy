# Story 1.18: Caddy Reload on Config Changes

**Epic:** Epic 1 - setup-vps.sh Core Functionality Testing
**Priority:** Should-have

## Description

Verify Caddy is reloaded only when configuration actually changes.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] First run generates Caddyfile and reloads Caddy
- [x] Second run with identical configuration detects no diff
- [x] Second run logs "No Caddy config changes" and skips reload
- [x] Third run with change (e.g., new domain) regenerates and reloads

## Dependencies

Story 1.17

## Testing Notes

```bash
# First run
./setup-vps.sh 2>&1 | grep -E "Caddyfile|reload"
# Should show generation and reload

# Second run (immediately, no changes)
./setup-vps.sh 2>&1 | grep "No Caddy config changes"
# Should show message about no changes

# Third run with change (e.g., add new domain)
# Should show regeneration and reload
```
