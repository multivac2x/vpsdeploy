# Story 4.3: Disk Full Scenario

**Epic:** Epic 4 - Error Handling and Edge Cases
**Priority:** Should-have

## Description

Verify script handles out-of-disk-space condition gracefully.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Simulate full disk (or nearly full) on VPS
- [x] Rsync attempt fails with "No space left on device"
- [x] Script exits with error showing rsync output
- [x] No partial deployment overwrites existing files (rsync is atomic per file)
- [x] Error message suggests checking disk usage

## Dependencies

Actual execution with controlled disk quota

## Testing Notes

```bash
# On VPS, fill disk or set quota
# Then run deploy.sh
./deploy.sh

# Should fail with rsync error about no space
# Exit code non-zero
```
