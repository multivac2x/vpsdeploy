# Story 1.19: Directory Setup - Static Domain

**Epic:** Epic 1 - setup-vps.sh Core Functionality Testing
**Priority:** Must-have

## Description

Verify correct directory structure is created for static domains.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Directory `${VPS_BASE_PATH}/${DOMAIN}` is created (default: `/var/www/example.com`)
- [x] Directory is owned by `VPS_USER` (default: deploy)
- [x] Parent directories created if missing
- [x] Directory permissions allow read/write for owner

## Dependencies

Story 1.10 (actual execution)

## Testing Notes

```bash
# After setup-vps.sh with static domain
ssh deploy@vps "ls -ld /var/www/example.com"
# Should show: drwxr-xr-x 2 deploy deploy

# If VPS_BASE_PATH custom:
ssh deploy@vps "ls -ld /custom/path/example.com"
```
